## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add the initial bounded, workflow-oriented `any-mcp` scaffold using `rmcp`
  2.2.0 and protocol revision `2026-07-28`.
- Add authenticated long-lived Anytype client startup, bounded and cancellable
  upstream execution, request/startup timeouts, stderr-only diagnostics, and
  clean stdio EOF shutdown.
- Harden runtime shutdown to cancel active and queued operations on EOF, emit
  safe structured operation outcomes, and deny payload-bearing dependency
  tracing targets independently of `RUST_LOG` directives.
- Enable operation diagnostics by default with server-generated correlation
  IDs and variant-only Anytype error categories/status codes.
