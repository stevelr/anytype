## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add the initial bounded, workflow-oriented `any-mcp` scaffold using `rmcp`
  2.2.0 and protocol revision `2026-07-28`.
- Add authenticated long-lived Anytype client startup, bounded and cancellable
  upstream execution, request/startup timeouts, stderr-only diagnostics, and
  clean stdio EOF shutdown.
- Harden runtime shutdown to cancel active and queued operations on EOF, emit
  safe structured operation outcomes, and deny payload-bearing dependency
  tracing targets independently of `RUST_LOG` directives.
- Enable operation diagnostics by default with server-generated correlation
  IDs and variant-only Anytype error categories/status codes.
- Add strict JSON Schema 2020-12 input/output contracts, bounded object
  summaries and resource URIs, standard tool annotations, structured results
  with compact JSON text fallbacks, and stable secret-safe execution errors.
- Add reusable bounded pagination, versioned process-lifetime cursors bound to
  normalized queries, Unicode-safe body chunking, and collection/filter caps.
- Convert candidate-rich `anytype-api` resolver ambiguities directly into
  bounded MCP errors, retaining valid alternatives alongside malformed ones;
  resolver scan-limit failures map to the stable `bounded_result` code.
- Enforce configurable finite Anytype JSON and document response budgets while
  chunks arrive, and map secret-safe oversized-response failures to
  `bounded_result`.

### Changed

- Harden schema contracts to reject unconstrained nested values, maps, arrays,
  numbers, untagged unions, and unsupported dynamic schema applicators; link
  success encoding to each declared output type and require bounded candidates
  before returning ambiguity errors.
